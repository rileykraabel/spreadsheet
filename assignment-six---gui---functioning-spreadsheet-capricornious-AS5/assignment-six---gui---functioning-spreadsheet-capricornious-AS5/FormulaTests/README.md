# Comments to Evaluators:
    There is a large number of tests because I wanted to be sure that the code would work for either constructor. 
    I also used some tests from the EvalGradingTests file from Assignment1. I did not achieve full code coverage
    because I could not figure out how to get the code to throw in some cases, as I did not have full code coverage
    for Assignment 1. I also had one return statement that I could never get to throw because it would realistically 
    never get implemented (at the end of the Evaluate method).
