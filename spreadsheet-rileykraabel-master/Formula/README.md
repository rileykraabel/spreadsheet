# Comments to Evaluators:
    I chose to create a lot of private boolean methods determining the state of the parameter. This was done
    to avoid redundant code, because the past assignments I was marked off for that. I tried to implement the
    code in the most efficient way. I also chose to create a Parse method because I did not want to see all of 
    the code inside of the constructor method. 

    I implemented the code from my Evaluate method from Assignment 1, but I reduced a lot of redundant code from
    that as well.
